    <h1>Women in the Indian Armed Forces</h1>
    <img src="Womens in armed Forces.jpg" alt="Women officers in Indian Army" />
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025</p>
    <p>Women have been breaking barriers in the Indian Armed Forces across the Army, Navy, and Air Force. From flying fighter jets to serving in the Siachen base camp, women are increasingly taking on frontline roles.</p>
    <p>Recent milestones include:
      <ul>
        <li>Permanent commission for women officers</li>
        <li>First woman commanding a naval ship</li>
        <li>Entry into NDA for aspiring women cadets</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Beyond combat roles, women officers have excelled in intelligence, logistics, and strategic planning. Their contributions have not only improved operational effectiveness but also inspired a new generation of young women to consider careers in defense.</p>
    <p>The Indian military continues to foster inclusivity, leadership, and equal opportunity across ranks, signaling progressive change in a traditionally male-dominated sector.</p>
