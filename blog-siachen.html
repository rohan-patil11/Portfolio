    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025</p>
    <p>The Siachen Glacier, located at the northern tip of India, is known as the world's highest battlefield. Indian soldiers deployed here face temperatures as low as -60Â°C, avalanches, and thin oxygen levels while maintaining security at 18,000+ feet.</p>
    <p>Soldiers undergo intense training before deployment, and logistics like ration, clothing, and medical support are flown in by helicopter. Despite extreme hardships, their morale and discipline remain unmatched.</p>
    <p>Troops are rotated every 3 months, and the deployment is considered one of the toughest in the Indian Army. The glacier is strategically significant as it borders Pakistan and China.</p>
    <p>Life here is not just about survival; it involves constant vigilance, teamwork, and innovation to overcome environmental challenges. Soldiers use specially designed equipment and shelters to combat frostbite and altitude sickness.</p>
    <p>The human spirit's resilience on Siachen is a testament to the bravery and dedication of Indian soldiers who protect the nation's sovereignty in the harshest conditions on earth.</p>
